redone
======

A correct implementation of regular expressions, using finite state automata
rather than backtracking.

## tl;dr ##
Most regex implementations (except for GNU grep, GNU awk and a few others) use
backtracking, which (while adding support for backreferences) massively reduces
the efficiency of the implementation. Even the best backtracking implementations
have `O(2^n)` time complexity in several cases.

On the other hand, by using finite state automata, regular expression matching
can have `O(n)` time complexity (or possibly superlinear, if the implementation
uses NFAs and doesn't cache them to produce DFAs). In either case, the
differences [can be quite drastic](http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html):

## Usage ##
To use this, you just need to do the following:

```python3
>>> import redone
>>>
>>> pattern = "some pattern here"
>>> string = "some string here"
>>>
>>> # Pre-compiled version (recommended).
>>> r = redone.compile(pattern)
>>> r.match(string)
# <RegexMatch(...) ...>
>>> r.fullmatch(string)
# <RegexMatch(...) ...>
>>> r.search(string)
# <RegexMatch(...) ...>
>>> r.findall(string)
# [<RegexMatch(...) ...>, ...]
>>> r.finditer(string)
# <generator object ...>
>>> r.sub("replacement", string)
# "replaced string"
>>>
>>> # On-the-fly version.
>>> redone.match(pattern, string)
# <RegexMatch(...) ...>
>>> redone.fullmatch(pattern, string)
# <RegexMatch(...) ...>
>>> redone.search(pattern, string)
# <RegexMatch(...) ...>
>>> redone.findall(pattern, string)
# [<RegexMatch(...) ...>, ...]
>>> redone.finditer(pattern, string)
# <generator object ...>
>>> redone.sub(pattern, "replacement", string)
# "replaced string"
```

The following features are still "in the works":
* Proper UTF-8 support (the regex alphabet only includes `string.printable`).
* Flags (mainly case insensitivity).
* Submatch extraction.
* Assertions (`^`, `$`, `\b` and the like).
* Character class ranges (because apparently they are used a lot).

The following features are likely *not* to be implemented:
* ASCII escape sequences (there's no need, just embed them in the pattern).
* POSIX "special" character classes (`[:alnum:]`), just use character classes.
* Backreferences. Since implementing them in NFAs with polynomial time is
  NP-complete, the only solution is to use backtracking in that one case
  (which would massively complicate the codebase).

## Features ##
The `redone` regular expression language currently contains the following
features:

* Wildcard matching (`.`).
* Unions (`a|b`).
* Character sets (`[abc][^def]`).
* Regex grouping (`(ab(c))`).
* Repetition (`a?b*c+`).
* Counted repetition (`a{2}b{3,}c{4,5}`).

## Warnings ##
* This was made in order to prove a point (and as a programming exercise).
  Python's mantra is that it is "fast enough", so the backtracking approach used
  by `re` seems to match that. Also, I'd argue that using the well-tested `re`
  module is *much safer* than using an implementation some random on the
  internet wrote, and that the speed issue isn't a big deal on most regular
  expressions.
* While finite state automata are *theoretically* faster than backtracking, in
  practice, the C code written is better optimised for common patterns and is
  better tested. That doesn't mean that the `re` module doesn't suffer from the
  "perl problem", it just means that (in most usecases) that isn't an issue.
* Not suitable for programmers under the age of 3.
